The goal of this pet project is to experiment with building recommendation engines for video games purchases. The data used are 2 Steam dataset, one of which contains data on users, what games they bought and how many hours they palyed.
The other contains info on the games, like generes, tags, publishers etc.

The project will is diveded into 3 parts:
Part 1 is basic yet comprehensive analysis focusing on understanding both datasets, building classification models (which are proto-rec_engines) and playing with basic feature generation.
In Part 2 we will try to tackle the imbalanced classes problems and generate more features from text values
In Part 3 we will use collaborative filtering to build our recommender engine
